/*3) Design a class that can be used by a health care professional to keep track of a patient’s vital statistics. The following are the details.

Name of the class - Patient

Member Variables - patientName(String),height(double),weight(double)

Member Function - double computeBMI()

The above method should compute the BMI and return the result. The formula for computation of BMI is weight (in kg) ÷ height*height(in metres).

Create an object of the Patient class and check the results.*/
